# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
This project is a desktop-based Traffic Sign Classification System built using Python and Tkinter with deep learning capabilities powered by Keras. The system allows users to upload an image of a traffic sign and instantly classifies it into one of the 43 known traffic sign categories.

## 💡 Features
- GUI built with Tkinter
- Traffic sign classification using CNN (Keras model)
- Real-time image upload and prediction
- Trained on GTSRB dataset (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)
